## 🧩 Data Description

### 🔹 `data/npz`
This folder stores six `.npz` files representing key wireless channel characteristics:
- **passloss** — path loss matrix  
- **zod / zoa** — zenith of departure and arrival  
- **aoa / aod** — azimuth of arrival and departure  
- **delay** — multipath delay spread or per-path delay  

All matrices share the same spatial dimensions, making them directly comparable for machine learning or propagation analysis.

### 🔹 `data/txt`
Contains detailed **multipath propagation information** for each simulation or measurement case.

### 🔹 `environment/`
This folder contains `.npz` matrices describing the physical environment that affects radio propagation:
- **building.npz** — 0 means open space; other values represent building height.  
- **bs.npz** — 0 means open space; numbers (1, 2, 3, …) represent base stations corresponding to entries in the `data` folder. If multiple stations overlap, the highest index is shown.  
- **tree.npz** — 0 means open space; 1 indicates vegetation or green area.
